# datacard-to-pyhf

Translates datacards used with [CMS `Combine`](https://github.com/cms-analysis/HiggsAnalysis-CombinedLimit) to a [`pyhf`](https://pyhf.readthedocs.io/) `HistFactory` workspace in `JSON` format.
This repository exists as an exploration to learn more about the CMS approach used in `Combine`.
It is incomplete, supports only a subset of systematics, and there are likely other issues with it.
